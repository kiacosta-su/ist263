        <p>Houston, also known as H-town for short and Bayou City from the numerous 
            bayous that run in the city, is America’s fourth-largest city and third-largest county (Harris).
            Home to more than 2.4 million residents, Houston is an ethnically diverse place to live in, whose demographics
            “reflect the future of American Cities” (Thrillist, 2017). Offering a wide variety of things to do, stunning world-class arts,
            and delightful award-winning cuisine, Houston is the city to travel to on your next vacation. </p>

                            <h3>Culture</h3>
                            <p>The culture of Houston does not represent your ordinary American city. There are over 145 different 
                                languages spoken in the metropolitan area with a third of its residents being able to speak 5 other 
                                languages besides English. With cuisine from all around the world representing more than 70 countries and American 
                                regions, Houston can be considered to have one if not the best culinary scenes in the country. There are over 10,000 
                                restaurants to choose from varying in flavor, price, and atmosphere. Another characteristic that separates this beloved
                                city from the rest of the U.S is its means of transportation, its climate, and its shopping experience. </p>
