            <!--retweak the paragraph, talk about how important sports are to Houstonians-->
            <p>The culture of Houston does not represent your ordinary American city. There are over 145 different languages spoken in the metropolitan area with a third of its residents being able to speak 5 other languages besides English. With cuisine from all around the world representing more than 70 countries and American 
            regions, Houston can be considered to have one if not the best culinary scenes in the country. There are over 10,000 
            restaurants to choose from varying in flavor, price, and atmosphere. Another characteristic that separates this beloved
            city from the rest of the U.S is its means of transportation, its climate, and its shopping experience.</p>

            <p>No matter what your age is or what you consider is fun to do, Houston has something for everyone. Whether it be with alongside your significant other, a group of friends or family, Houston is bound to offer something you can all enjoy.

            Offering over 10,000 restaurants to choose from from over  70 countries, it is no wonder Houston delivers on its reputation.</p>
