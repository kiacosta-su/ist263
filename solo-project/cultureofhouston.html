                    <p>Houston is heavily based on its freeway system. With limited public transportation and few walkable areas, operating a vehicle is a must in Bayou City. The Houston area is so huge that driving long distances is a way of life. About 90% of all Houstonians own their vehicle in comparison to New York City residents who only about 10% have a vehicle. Anyone that has to commute under 30 minutes to work is living life. Noticing an increase in traffic, Houston is making an effort to become more bike-friendly, as of now bike trails and lanes are limited Downtown making driving on two wheels difficult and dangerous, as drivers are forced to pull into cross-walks to see around corners. </p>

                    <p>Humidity is part of life in Houston. Instead of complaining about it, just learn to live with it, it tends to get easier trust me. The good thing is that you donâ€™t need a coat. Houston coldest month January average temperature is 53 degrees, much unlike a New England Fall or Christmas. It is acceptable to wear flip-flops year-round, nobody is prone to judge you. </p>

A popular destination too many shopaholics is the The Galleria. Home to over 400 first-class stores and eateries, The Galleria is the largest shopping center in Texas and fourth largest domain nationally.</p>
